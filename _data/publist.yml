  description: This paper presents a new way to rapidly assess variant function using cloud deep learning. Since most tumor suppressors have well-defined subcellular localizations, our approach could be widely applied to functionalize variants of uncertain significance and help improve the utility of genetic testing.

- title: "A Premalignant Cell-Based Model for Functionalization and Classification of PTEN Variants"
  image: Pub2.png
  description: As sequencing becomes more economical, we are identifying sequence variations in the population faster than ever. For disease-associated genes, it is imperative that we differentiate a sequence variant as either benign or pathogenic, such that the appropriate therapeutic interventions or surveillance can be implemented. This assay outperformed computational predictions, was scalable, and had a short run time, serving as an ideal alternative for annotating the clinical significance of cancer-associated PTEN variants.

- #title: "Imaging moiré deformation and dynamics in twisted bilayer graphene"
  #image: TBG_SL.png
  #description: Why is there so much variation in TBG devices? And are open devices more disordered than encapsulated ones? We introduce a new method to continuously map inhomogeneities of a moiré lattice and apply it to open-device TBG to show that twist angle variation is small over areas of hundreds of nm.
